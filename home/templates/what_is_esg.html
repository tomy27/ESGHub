        <h1>What is ESG?</h1>
        <h4>A management and analysis framework to understand and measure how sustainably an organization is operating.</h4>
        <div class="container text-start p-3 pt-4">
            <p>ESG is a framework that helps stakeholders understand how an organization is managing risks and opportunities related to environmental, social, and governance criteria (sometimes called ESG factors). ESG is an acronym for <strong>Environmental, Social, and Governance</strong>. ESG takes the holistic view that sustainability extends beyond just environmental issues.</p>
            <p>While the term ESG is often used in the context of investing, stakeholders include not just the investment community but also customers, suppliers, and employees, all of whom are increasingly interested in how sustainable an organizationâ€™s operations are.</p>
